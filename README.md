## Cart app

A small cart app, built with react and redux without any focus on the UI. Just to practice the redux with
typescript. Used thunk as async middleware and fake-store to get the products data.

PS:Don't take this app too serious. You may look into the structure and redux stuff with typescript but not the project features. Thanks :p
